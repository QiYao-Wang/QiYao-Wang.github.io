<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Now I am an undergraduate from Dalian University of Technology (DUT). 

I am currently pursuing a bachelor degree in Artificial Intelligence *(2021-2025)*. During my undergraduate studies, I worked in the Dalian University of *Technology Information Retrieval Laboratory* and *Public Service Science and Engineering Laboratory*, fortunately supervised by Prof. [Yuan Lin](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/linyuan/zh_CN/index.htm) and Prof. [Kan Xu](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/2004012069/en/index.htm). I warmly welcome undergraduates from DUT to join our research group for collaborative exploration. For more details, please visit our [website](https://dut-ipai.github.io/). For those interested in collaboration, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I will start my Ph.D. studies at CAS-SIAT in 2025, fortunately supervised by Prof. [Min Yang](https://minyang.me/).

[IPEval: A Bilingual Intellectual Property Agency Consultation Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models
](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.12386)

***Qiyao Wang**, Jianguo Huang, Shule Lu, Yuan Lin, Kan Xu, Liang Yang, Hongfei Lin*

<p><strong>TL;DR: </strong>IPEval introduces a benchmark for assessing Large Language Models' (LLMs) performance in intellectual property (IP) law with 2,657 questions. It evaluates LLMs across key IP areas using zero-shot, 5-few-shot, and Chain of Thought (CoT) approaches. Findings highlight the need for specialized IP LLMs due to language proficiency bias. The benchmark is crucial for developing LLMs with deeper IP knowledge.</p>
